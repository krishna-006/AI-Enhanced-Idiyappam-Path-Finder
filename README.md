### Project Description
[To detect the start end and untangling of a single noodle/thread in an idiyappam using computer vision and machine learning]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[It‚Äôs like asking a robot to first look at your breakfast, then turn it into a black-and-white sketch, then trace every noodle, and finally try to separate them like a very patient toddler with chopsticks ‚Äî all while filming the process.No one in history has ever complained that their idiyappam wasn‚Äôt sufficiently computer-analyzed‚Ä¶ until now. üòÑ]
